Goldbug Cipher Tasks
The methods that are described in this story have been used to encrypt the following important message.

$%!<]%!<>%.)(/:%]/?!,,(!@%!@%<]~//$(/,)$!]!.$<%>?<.>/=#(//,&%%,).~<%=>%$!.$<%&<%=(%$!.$<%!$]&/<]%!<%,%@%.

â€¦but there is a problem! This message does not contain enough characters to allow a meaningful analysis of the number of characters and the probability of each character representing an English character.
Luckily a much longer story has also been encrypted using the same key. There is also a vb.net program that will count how many characters there are in that story.
If you are clever, you should be able to use the frequency (count) of the letters in this story to make educated guesses about the most likely letter that is represented in this message.
If you are very clever, you might be able to write a program that can decrypt the encrypted  message!

Step 1: Download the short and long encrypted messages and save them to your OneDrive.
Step 2: Copy the vb.net program and run it.
Step 3: Crack the code!
